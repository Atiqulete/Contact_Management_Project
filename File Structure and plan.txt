Add Contact:
Users can add a new contact by providing Name, Email, Phone Number, and Address.
The program checks if the phone number already exists in the contact list. If it does, the user is notified.

Users can update the details of a contact by searching for the phone number and modifying its Name, Email, Phone Number, or Address.

Search Contact:
Users can search for a specific contact by Name, Email, or Phone Number. The search term is matched against existing contacts.
